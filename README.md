Gradient_Delauney_heatmap
========================

Using property values calculates gradient based on a Delauney triangulation

Referance code is in the /ref folder

trigradient_demo.py : This example is a good referance for taking a set of points with location and value(calculated)
                      and constricting a Delauney triagulation and then calculated gradiant. The plot is not quite
                      what we want.
