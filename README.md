Gradient_Delauney_heatmap
========================

Using property values calculates gradient based on a Delauney triangulation

Referance code is in the /ref folder

trigradient_demo.py : This example is a good referance for taking a set of points with location and value(calculated)
                      and constricting a Delauney triagulation and then calculated gradiant. The plot is not quite
                      what we want.
                      
 Jeff Kaufman has some great maps using rent data. Visualy this is what I want.
      Here are some examples http://rentheatmap.com/
      Code here https://github.com/jeffkaufman/apartment_prices
      He uses his own K nearest algorythm, scipy has an implimentation here
